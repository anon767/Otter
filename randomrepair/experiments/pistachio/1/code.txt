/*
	Code is taken from LSH version 0.1.3. The function handles connection initialization; it should respond to a client message containing protocol version information with a similar message. The developers do not support SSH1 in this
version. However, even if they wanted to return a disconnect, this should have been packed as a PROTOVER message.
	The rule checks that the message sent is of type MSGTYPE_PROTOVER.
	
	Estimated difficulty for abduction: Very Low

	Solution: Replace MSGTYPE_DISCONNECT by MSGTYPE_PROTOVER in the first call to pack_message
