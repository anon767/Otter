STP is a decision procedure for the satisfiability
of quantifier-free formulas in the theory of bit-vectors and arrays
that has been optimized for large problems encountered in software
analysis applications.  The basic architecture of the procedure
consists of word-level pre-processing algorithms followed by
translation to SAT.  The primary bottlenecks in software verification
and bug finding applications are large arrays and linear bit-vector
arithmetic. New algorithms based on the abstraction-refinement
paradigm are presented for reasoning about large arrays. A solver for
bit-vector linear arithmetic is presented that eliminates variables
and parts of variables to enable other transformations, and reduce the
size of the problem that is eventually received by the SAT solver.

These and other algorithms have been implemented in STP, which has
been heavily tested over thousands of examples obtained from several
real-world applications.  Experimental results indicate that the above
mix of algorithms along with the overall architecture is far more
effective, for a variety of applications, than a direct translation of
the original formula to SAT or other comparable decision procedures.
