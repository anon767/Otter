\section{Conclusion}
Software applications such as program analysis, bug finding, and
symbolic simulation of software tend to impose different conditions on
decision procedures than hardware applications. In particular, arrays
become a bottleneck. Also, the constraints tend to be very large with
lots of linear bit-vector arithmetic in them. 
Abstraction-refinement algorithms 
is often helpful for handling large array terms.
Also, the approach of doing phased word-level
transformations, starting with the least expensive and risky 
transformations, followed by translation
to SAT seems like a good design for decision procedures for the
applications considered. Finally, linear solving, when implemented
carefully, is effective in variable elimination.
