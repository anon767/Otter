\section{Conclusion}
Software applications such as program analysis, bug finding and
symbolic simulation of software tend to impose different conditions on
decision procedures than hardware applications. In particular, arrays
become a bottleneck. Also, the constraints tend to be very large with
lots of linear bit-vector arithmetic in them. In STP, the efficacy of
abstraction-refinement based algorithms for handling large array terms
has been demonstrated. Also, the approach of doing phased word-level
transformations (simple transformations first) followed by translation
to SAT seems like a good design for decision procedures for the
applications considered. Finally, linear solving, when done right, is
effective in variable elimination.
