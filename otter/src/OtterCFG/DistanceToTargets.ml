(** Find the shortest distance from an {!Instruction.t} to a list of target {!Instruction.t}s.

    Distances are calculated by counting instructions along a path up to a function return within the function of
    the source instruction. If a function call occurs along a path, the minimum of the distance from the first
    instruction to the targets in the call targets, or the shortest distance through the call targets, is added.

    @return the shortest distance to one of the targets, or {!max_int} if none of the targets are reachable.
