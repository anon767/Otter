ngIRCd supports one aspect of Zeroconf Networking[1]: Multicast DNS (mDNS[2])
with DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD[3]).

To use this features you can use one of two APIs:

  a) Apple "Bonjour" API as used by Mac OS X,
  b) the Howl[4] Zeroconf library or the Howl compatibility layer
     of the newer Avahi[5] library.

When calling the configure script using the "--with-zeroconf" switch the
avalable API will be autodetected and the required additional libraries will
be linked to the ngircd binary as required.

ngIRCd then registers a DNS-SD service for each port it is listening on using
the service type "_ircu._tcp.".
