ngIRCd actually doesn't support secure connections for client-server or
server-server links using SSL, the Secure Socket Layer, by itself. But you can
use the stunnel(8) command to make this work.

Stefan Sperling (stefan at binarchy dot net) mailed me the following text as a
short "how-to", thanks Stefan!


=== snip ===
    ! This guide applies to stunnel 4.x !

    Put this in your stunnel.conf:

        [ircs]
        accept = 6667
        connect = 6668

    This makes stunnel listen for incoming connections
    on port 6667 and forward decrypted data to port 6668.
    We call the connection 'ircs'. Stunnel will use this
    name when logging connection attempts via syslog.
    You can also use the name in /etc/hosts.{allow,deny}
    if you run tcp-wrappers.

    To make sure ngircd is listening on the port where
    the decrypted data arrives, set

        Ports = 6668

    in your ngircd.conf.

    Start stunnel and restart ngircd.

    That's it.
    Don't forget to activate ssl support in your irc client ;)

Probably ngIRCd will include support for SSL in the future ...
