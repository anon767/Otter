.SH NAME
ngIRCd \- the next generation IRC daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ngircd [
.I Options
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR ngIRCd
is a free open source daemon for the Internet Relay Chat (IRC),
developed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
.PP
It's written from scratch and is not based upon the original IRCd like
many others. It is easy to configure, supports server links (even with
original ircd's) and runs on hosts with changing IP addresses (such as
dial-in networks).
.PP
Currently supported platforms include AIX, A/UX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, IRIX,
Linux, Mac OS X, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and Windows with Cygwin.
.PP
As ngIRCd relies on UNIX standards and uses GNU automake and GNU autoconf
there are good chances that it also supports other UNIX-based operating
systems as well. By default, ngIRCd writes diagnostic and informational messages using
the syslog mechanism.
.SH OPTIONS
The default behaviour of
.BR ngircd
is to read its standard configuration file (see below), to detach from the
controlling terminal and to wait for clients.
.PP
You can use these options to modify this default:
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR \fIfile\fR
Use
.I file
as configuration file.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-nodaemon\fR
Don't fork a child and don't detach from controlling terminal.
All log messages go to the console and you can use CTRL-C to
terminate the server.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-passive\fR
Disable automatic connections to other servers. You can use the IRC command
CONNECT later on as IRC Operator to link this ngIRCd to other servers.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-configtest\fR
Read, validate and display the configuration; then exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display a brief help text and exit.
