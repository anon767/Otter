Simplify bytes as they are constructed

Have concrete values underlying symbolic values, and check which path
the concrete value would take at a branch. This would enable us to
only call STP once per 'if'.

Profile to see where inefficiencies lie

Make output more customizable, and make it easier to find the source
of errors (structural output ... can XML play a part?)

Report errors in ways other than printing them to the screen

Refactor to make more modular

Be consistent about numerical representations and types (e.g., do we
ever store something greater than 255 in a char, relying on the type
to make sure we always use it as the right value?)

Allow concrete values to be plugged in for symbolic values when an
equality becomes part of the path condition

Don't initialize function parameters with symbolic values; just plug
in the arguments

Experiment with using other SMT solvers. (Is the boundary with STP
clean enough that this will be easy?)

Migrate to CIL 1.3.7

Improve --mergePaths:
	- Calculation of dominators isn't really the right way to find merge
	points
	- 'Will merge on function return' might want to be replaced with a
	one-return transformation
	- Elimination of non-live variables might make this simpler/more
	effective

Richer execution semantics:
	- branch on dereferencing symbolic pointers. If a pointer takes n
	values, fork n branches.
	- (what else?)

Hashcons?

Heuristics to avoid too much branching?

Better handling of strings?

Use a real libc implementation?

Handle multiple processes

Have a fixed header space (so things can be run cross-platform)

The Cil CFG is not perfect (e.g., stmt block structure, line numbers for goto's, ...).
Perhaps we want to transform the Cil.file into another intermediate structure before executing.
(This has a benefit that it's easier to migrate to another C analyzer in the future.)


Handle alloca() properly.
