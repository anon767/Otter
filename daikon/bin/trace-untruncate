# This script removes the last (possibly partial) record from a .dtrace file.
# More specifically, it removes the last paragraph of a file (everything
# after the last double-newline).

# The script operates by side effect, changing the files whose names are
# given on the command line; however, it leaves the original versions in a
# backup file whose name has suffix ".bak".
