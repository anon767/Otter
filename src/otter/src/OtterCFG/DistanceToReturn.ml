(** Find the shortest distance from an {!Instruction.t} to a function return.

    Distances are calculated by counting instructions along a path to a function return within the function of
    the source instruction. If a function call occurs along a path, the shortest distance through the call targets is
    added.

    @return the shortest distance to a function return, or {!max_int} if no function returns are reachable.
